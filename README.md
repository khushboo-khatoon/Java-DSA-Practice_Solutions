# Java DSA Practice Solutions

Welcome to my **Java DSA Practice Repository** â€” a collection of Data Structure and Algorithm solutions written in **Java**.  
This roadmap tracks my progress from beginner to advanced level in DSA.

---



## 1. Basics / Foundations
Build a strong base with fundamental data structures:
- Arrays  
- Strings  
- ArrayList / Dynamic Array  
- HashMap / HashSet  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Linked List  
  - Singly Linked List  
  - Doubly Linked List  
  - Circular Linked List  



## 2. Intermediate Level
Strengthen problem-solving and learn tree-based concepts:
- Recursion  
- Backtracking  
- Binary Tree  
- Binary Search Tree (BST)  


## 3. Advanced Topics
Master higher-level DSA concepts used in interviews:
- Heap / Priority Queue  
- Graphs  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Dynamic Programming (DP)  





## 4. Bonus / Optional Advanced Topics
Dive into specialized and competitive programming structures:
- Tries  
- Disjoint Set Union (DSU / Union-Find)  
- Segment Tree  
- Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)  




## Goal
- Strengthen understanding of **core Data Structures in Java**  
- Solve topic-wise problems consistently  
- Prepare efficiently for **coding interviews and placements**  




## ðŸ“‚ Repository Includes
- Topic-wise Java files   
- Practice problems from **GeeksforGeeks**, **LeetCode**
